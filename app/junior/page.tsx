    },
    {
      question: "Do I need prior coding experience?",
      answer:
        "No, prior programming knowledge is not required. The Junior Competition is designed to be fun and beginner-friendly, encouraging creativity and imagination while introducing students to coding in a supportive way.",
    },
    {
      question: "Which programming platform will be used?",
      answer: "All projects must be made in Scratch. This ensures that the focus remains on storytelling, creativity, and problem-solving rather than technical depth.",
    },
    {
      question: "When and how will the competition take place?",
      answer:
        "The Junior round will be held onsite at Fatimiyah Boys School and Fatimiyah Girls School on 13th September 2025 in a single two-hour session. Internet access will be restricted during the contest, and all submissions must be provided as a Scratch file.",
    },
    {
      question: "What should I bring on the competition day?",
      answer:
        "Participants must bring their JCIC card for verification. You do not need to bring your own laptop, as computers with Scratch installed will be provided onsite for all participants.",
    },
    {
      question: "How should I prepare for the event?",
      answer:
        "Students are encouraged to practice Scratch basics in advance. Working with loops, conditions, and variables will help build confidence and allow participants to focus on creativity during the contest.",
    },
    {
      question: "What support will be available during the competition?",
      answer:
        "Organizers and mentors will be available to provide technical assistance with Scratch setup and ensure everything runs smoothly. However, they will not help with solving the actual challenge.",
    },
    {
      question: "What rewards can participants expect?",
      answer: "Top performers will receive prizes worth up to PKR 100,000 such as Laptops and much more, along with recognition at the closing ceremony. However, all the participants will get e-certificates. More importantly, participants will gain confidence, exposure, and the chance to showcase their talent.",
    },
    {
      question: "What type of questions will be asked in the competition?",
      answer:
        "The questions in the Junior Competition will be based around a problem statement. Participants will be asked to create a Scratch project, such as a game, story, or animation, that addresses the given challenge. These problem statements are designed to test creativity, logical thinking, and the ability to translate ideas into interactive Scratch projects.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the judging criteria for the Junior Competition?",
      answer: "Projects will be judged on creativity, functionality, coding logic, code organization, user experience, and bonus features such as sound, levels, or animations. A total of 100 marks will be distributed across these categories.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are Grade 11 students allowed to participate in the Junior Competition?",

    {
      question: "Will there be a viva or presentation of the project?",
      answer:
        "Some shortlisted participants may be asked to briefly present their project to the judges, explain the logic they used, and answer simple questions about how it works.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use pre-made projects or templates in my submission?",
      answer:
        "No, pre-made Scratch templates or previously built projects are not allowed. However, participants are free to use all built-in Scratch assets such as sprites, sounds, and backgrounds that are already available within the Scratch library.",
    },
    {
      question: "How can I practice before the competition?",
      answer:
        "You can practice on: Scratch official website (Scratch - Imagine, Program, Share), Scratch tutorials on YouTube, Beginner courses on Khan Academy â€“ Computer Science basics",
    },
    {
      question: "How will the winners be announced?",
      answer:
        "Judging will take place after all submissions are reviewed. Winners will be announced at the Awards & Closing Ceremony of CodeBash Seniors on 14th September 2025, and the top participants will be contacted by the management.",
